## what is this

dynamic access and change python object.

if got a nested python object( list of list, dict of dict , etc ), like the following, and dont know its structure,
but want to access its elements( string, int, long, bool, etc ), use this

example:

```python
from pprint import pprint
from j_pentest_pyobj import objwalk, objset

obj = [
    None,
    1,
    'string',
    True,
    False,
    { 'a': 'b' },
    [1,2,3, {'a':'a'}, ],
]

for path, value in objwalk( obj ):
    print path, value 

    objset( obj, path, '2333' )

    pprint(obj)

    print '='*30
```
